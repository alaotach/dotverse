# DotVerse Drawing Minigame - Implementation Status

## Overview
A multiplayer drawing minigame where players join lobbies, vote on themes, draw within time limits, vote on each other's drawings, and receive prizes based on rankings.

## ✅ Completed Components

### Backend (Python)
- **Models** (`minigame/models.py`): Core game logic with Player, Drawing, and Lobby classes
- **Lobby Manager** (`minigame/lobby_manager.py`): Handles lobby creation and lifecycle
- **Game Runner** (`minigame/game_runner.py`): Manages game state transitions and timing
- **WebSocket Server** (`minigame/websocket_server.py`): Real-time communication with frontend

### Node.js API
- **Prize Distribution Endpoint**: `/api/minigame/distribute-prizes` - Awards coins to winners
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/minigame/health` - Service status monitoring

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **WebSocket Service** (`services/minigameWebSocketService.ts`): Communication with Python server
- **Minigame Button** (`components/minigame/MinigameButton.tsx`): Entry point component

## 🔧 How to Run

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
cd c:\Users\nobit\dotVerse
pip install websockets requests
```

### 2. Start the Python WebSocket Server
```bash
cd minigame
python websocket_server.py
```
Server runs on `ws://localhost:8765`

### 3. Start the Node.js Server (if not already running)
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
Server runs on `http://localhost:3001`

### 4. Test API Integration
```bash
python test_minigame_api.py
```
